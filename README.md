## About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Lamsihar. Since the beginning of 2022 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to finally find a field that I can pursue to develop myself. I challenge myself to learn new things about software testing, because for me, one of the proudest moments is when I managed to find a bug that breaks the system in the final stage of product testing. I want to improve my skills to be better in the future and create something that can be useful for people out there. In this portfolio, I want to share my knowledge of QA and show the practical skills that I have acquired through courses, self-study, and my work. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation, so right now my main focus is to develop my knowledge and practice in this field.
