## About Me üëã
Hi, my name is Lamsihar. Since the beginning of 2022 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to finally find a field that I can pursue to develop myself. I challenge myself to learn new things about software testing, because for me, one of the proudest moments is when I managed to find a bug that breaks the system in the final stage of product testing. I want to improve my skills to be better in the future and create something that can be useful for people out there. In this portfolio, I want to share my knowledge of QA and show the practical skills that I have acquired through courses, self-study, and my work. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation, so right now my main focus is to develop my knowledge and practice in this field.

## My Experience  üè¢
I have 3 years of experience as a QA Engineer and am highly passionate about software testing. I find great interest in ensuring that software runs smoothly and reliably throughout the development lifecycle.
I have hands-on experience with automation testing for both web and mobile platforms using tools such as Selenium, WebdriverIO, and Cypress. I also understand the importance of manual testing, especially for features that are difficult to reach or verify through automation and I regularly write and execute manual test cases. For test case management, I‚Äôve worked with tools like Qase.io and TestRail.
In my previous projects, I was responsible for designing and executing test scenarios, documenting results, and reporting bugs directly in Jira. I take pride in being thorough, and one of my most rewarding moments was finding a critical bug during the final testing phase that prevented a major production issue.
I'm constantly challenging myself to learn new tools and techniques in the QA field. My goal is to continuously improve and contribute to building high-quality products that make a difference for users.
